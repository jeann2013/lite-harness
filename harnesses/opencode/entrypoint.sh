# and @ai-sdk/anthropic POSTs to {baseURL}/messages → .../v1/messages).
#
# Why not @ai-sdk/openai-compatible: that adapter stalls after tool calls with
# OpenAI-compatible gateways like LiteLLM (opencode#14972) — the agent runs a
# tool then goes silent. The Anthropic path doesn't. We keep the provider id
# "litellm" so UI/CLI/Slack model references (providerID:"litellm") still match.
#
# permission: every tool is "allow" or "deny" — never "ask", since headless
# `opencode serve` parks forever on the first "ask" prompt with no UI to approve
# it (opencode#16367). bash + edit are denied so the agent does its work in the
# E2B sandbox (provision/execute) and through MCP tools, not on the shared
# harness host. question is denied too — this agent runs autonomously and must
# not block waiting on a human to answer.
#
# Register every model the gateway serves so the client can pick any of them
# at /prompt_async time. opencode rejects any modelID absent from this map.
# Non-Claude models (GPT, Gemini, Bedrock, ...) work end-to-end as long as your
# LiteLLM gateway routes them through its Anthropic Messages passthrough
# (@ai-sdk/anthropic POSTs to {base}/messages).
